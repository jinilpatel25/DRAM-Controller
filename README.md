Dram memory is commonly used in 16/32 bit computers in place of Sram when large amounts of memory are required (e.g. multi-megabytes). However, Dram is more complicated to interface to the CPU and requires a dedicated controller to handle the interface, timing, initialization, and refreshing of DRAM memory chips. This project involves designing the DRAM Controller.
